# Novel Signer research archive

This repository separates reverse engineering notes by platform. The current release records what was reproduced against live interfaces, what is only an offline snapshot, and what remains unverified.

## Platform directories

- [ByteDance / Tomato](platforms/bytedance/tomato/README.md) — current `v7.1.3.32` request chain, header matrix, chapter decryption, search analysis, and the Rust integration boundary.
- [ByteDance / Douyin](platforms/bytedance/douyin/REPORT.md) — static/community algorithm inventory. The current online six-god interface was not tested in this workspace.
- [Qidian](platforms/qidian/REPORT.md) — an explicit evidence gap. No Qidian APK, signed sample, API matrix, or chapter decryption vector was available here.

The public evidence files contain endpoint names, parameter names, status/length/hash summaries, and local trial labels. They intentionally omit device identifiers, tokens, complete request headers, raw responses, APKs, native libraries, and reusable tickets.

## Current practical status

The Tomato Java/Unidbg bridge can produce a current-version sample accepted by the live directory and reader endpoints. The old pure-Python Medusa interpreter is parameterized only for an older 225-byte snapshot. Current VM9 diagnostics now carry a new detail input through all three segments with a state rule derived from paired captures. They still require captured initial state, native ARM64 callbacks, trace entry registers, and trained target bytes. Therefore the default Rust crate reports current Medusa as unavailable until those dependencies are independently reproduced. See the [current VM9 checkpoint](platforms/bytedance/tomato/VM9_PROGRESS.md).

## Build and checks

```text
python scripts/check_python.py
cargo check --manifest-path platforms/bytedance/tomato/rust/Cargo.toml
```

GitHub Actions runs the same checks, a public-data secret scan, and publishes `docs/` with GitHub Pages.

The `build-rust` workflow also produces Linux and Windows artifacts on manual dispatch or version tags. Those artifacts are the current Rust integration scaffold; they do not contain a current online Medusa implementation until the independent VM work is completed.
