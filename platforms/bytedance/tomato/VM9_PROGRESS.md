# Current VM9 progress checkpoint

This file records the current state of the independent VM9 work. It is a
checkpoint, not a completion claim.

## Reproduced diagnostic path

The historical `seg3_verified_final_20260929.txt` path can be reproduced with
the captured `event0_cb66_vm9_*` memory image and the real callback pages for
callbacks 9, 64, and 66. The fresh replay reached:

```text
SUMMARY events=1057/1057 callbacks=87 syscalls=3
```

This proves that the VM bytecode trace, the selected native callback execution,
and the recorded page injections are internally consistent for that captured
sample. It remains trace-assisted because the callback pages and native ARM64
execution are supplied externally.

## Current checkpoint mismatch

The newer `mem_after_seg2_full_diag_20260929.pkl` checkpoint does not reproduce
that path. It diverges at trace 758 after callback 8:

| Path | callback 8 allocator result | callback 8 writes |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| reproduced historical path | `0x1296b940` | 80 |
| new full-Seg2 checkpoint | `0x1296ba60` | 33 |

The native callback therefore selects a different allocator/free-list branch.
The divergence is before callback 9's real-page injection and is not fixed by
adding Perseus, changing the timestamp, or replaying the same callback pages.

The follow-up allocator audit narrowed the branch further. For callback 8 the
requested size maps to size class `3` and bin `0x12282060`. The historical
checkpoint has count `0` and returns `0x1296b940` through the refill path; the
new checkpoint has count `4` and returns `0x1296ba60` from free-list index `2`.
Forcing only the count to zero, or copying the complete `0x12282000` bin page,
still returned `0x1296b9a0`. Native disassembly and a controlled transplant
then isolated the missing state to the slab counter `[0x1294110c]` and bitmap
word `[0x12941128]`; with those two fields plus the count corrected, callback 8
returned `0x1296b940`.

## Seg1 entry-base and native-frame corrections

The first independent Seg1 runner used the nested-frame jump-base field that
belongs to the later segments. That made the first apparent branch at trace
120 look like a VM or allocator mismatch. Re-running with the actual Seg1
entry base `0x1235a6f0` removed that false divergence. A second mismatch was
then isolated to the native callback context: the diagnostic runner still used
Seg2's `SP=0xe4ffbd70` and `X29=0xe4ffbe90` for Seg1, while the captured Seg1
frame has `SP=0xe4ffb320` and `X29=0xe4ffb440`. With the wrong frame, callback
19 overwrote its argument area and callback 20 reached libc's explicit
`Invalid address 0xe4ffb848 passed to free` abort. Returning zero from
`exit_group` in the early syscall probe had hidden that abort and produced an
irrelevant unmapped read and `accept4` loop.

With the Seg1 frame corrected, the real ARM64 callback runner completed the
captured Seg1 trace: `4592/4592` VM events, 85 callbacks, and one `madvise`
syscall. No callback-page injection was needed for this Seg1 run. The resulting
checkpoint advanced into Seg2 and matched its first 10 native callbacks. The
sanitized diagnostic record is
[evidence/vm9_seg1_frame_probe_20260930.json](evidence/vm9_seg1_frame_probe_20260930.json).

An earlier continuation reached callback 45 and appeared to diverge at VM
trace `12085` (`[0xe4ffcd00]` was `0x2f8` while the older checkpoint expected
`0x2f6`). Pairing the trace with its same-capture memory files showed that this
was a mixed-capture artifact: the paired trace also expects `0x2f8`. The old
`0x2f6` value came from a different capture/checkpoint and must not be copied
into the corrected run.

This is a diagnostic correction, not a completion claim. The runner still
executes captured ARM64 native code against captured memory, and its Seg1
`X22` frame value is inferred from the frame offset rather than directly
observed. The next independent proof must carry the corrected state through
Seg2 and Seg3 without captured-field transplants, then repeat with a fresh
input before treating it as a parameterized signer.

Applying that fixed checkpoint transplant at callback 8 allowed the full
captured Seg2 replay to complete at `90161/90161` events with `121` callbacks.
This closes the captured branch diagnostic, not the independent parameterization
requirement. See [ALLOCATOR_AUDIT.md](ALLOCATOR_AUDIT.md).

## Same-run full handoff capture (2026-09-30)

A fresh Unidbg capture was taken with a frozen clock and deterministic emulated
random source. Seg1 was replayed from that capture at `4592/4592` events and
85 callbacks. Full memory snapshots taken at the real host transitions were
then supplied to the offline runner:

- Seg2 reached `90153/90153` events and 121 callbacks from the real `NEXT#1`
  handoff, with no callback-page injection or allocator-field transplant.
- Seg3 reached callback 86 and event 1,028 from the real `NEXT#2` handoff. The
  first unexplained host-return boundary is the callback result slot at
  `0xe4ffe630`; setting that slot to the trace-observed zero as an explicit
  diagnostic override lets the replay complete at `1057/1057` events and 87
  callbacks.

This is stronger evidence about the segment and host handoff boundaries, but it
still consumes captured full-memory handoffs from one run. It is therefore a
trace-assisted diagnostic and not a fresh-input, pure-Python Medusa proof. The
sanitized record is
[evidence/vm9_handoff_probe_20260930.json](evidence/vm9_handoff_probe_20260930.json).

## Callback 86 clock-slot provenance (2026-09-30)

The earlier `0xe4ffe630` boundary was then watched in a real Unidbg run. At
entry to callback function `0x12545f60`, the slot contained `0x67e0c91`. The
native callback returned `x0=0`, and the write hook observed an 8-byte zero
store at `0xe4ffe630` from PC `0x12545f70`. The captured code at that PC is:

```text
0x12545f60: stp x30, x19, [sp, #-0x10]!
0x12545f64: mov x19, x0
0x12545f68: ldp x8, x0, [x0]
0x12545f6c: blr x8
0x12545f70: str x0, [x19, #0x10]
```

This identifies the zero as the ordinary result store performed by the native
callback wrapper after the indirect clock function returns. It is not an
unexplained Java-side or host-memory transplant. The sanitized record is
[evidence/vm9_clockslot_native_write_20260930.json](evidence/vm9_clockslot_native_write_20260930.json).

The offline `--clock-slot-zero` replay therefore modeled a real native store,
but it remains a diagnostic replay.

## Native clock model replay (2026-10-01)

The callback-86 path was traced through `0x125514d0 -> 0x12551488 ->
0x125e94b0 -> clock_gettime(1)`. The native helper converts the timespec to
nanoseconds, subtracts the saved start value `123456789000000` ns, then divides
the signed difference by 1000. The offline runner had supplied its wall-clock
timespec to clock ID 1. A same-input failure run returned a nonzero callback
result and diverged at VM event 1,028.

The runner now matches the real Unidbg handler: clock ID 0 uses the frozen wall
clock; nonzero IDs use the frozen monotonic value `123456789000000` ns. With
`--clock-slot-zero` disabled and no callback-page injection, the same Seg3
snapshot reached `1057/1057` events and 87 callbacks. Callback 86 naturally
returned zero and the native wrapper wrote it to `0xe4ffe630`. The sanitized
paired evidence is
[evidence/vm9_clock_model_replay_20261001.json](evidence/vm9_clock_model_replay_20261001.json).

This closes the clock-model discrepancy for one captured input. The runner
still depends on full memory handoffs and native ARM64 images from that run;
it is not yet a fresh-input pure-Python signer.

## Static constructor argument replay (2026-10-01)

The second captured URL exposed a concrete constructor-argument error in the
independent runner. Native constructor `0x12508344` treats nonzero `x1` as a
string pointer: it calls the length helper at `0x12607f40`, allocates
`strlen(x1)+1` through `0x12607fd0`, and copies through `0x12607f60`. The old
diagnostic used `0x1296ba90`, an allocator dynamic-area address. The same-capture
trace supplies `0x1232fe64` as the static argument for this replay.

The old dynamic pointer failed at trace event 13 with `r2=0` instead of
`0x122a0d00`. Re-running with `x1=0x1232fe64` completed Seg2 at
`90385/90385` events and 121 native callbacks. The resulting checkpoint matched
the ten captured `NEXT#2` handoff pages except for 153 bytes in two synthetic
native-stack pages. Starting Seg3 directly from that checkpoint still failed at
callback 9, so the full host handoff has not been removed. Supplying the
captured `NEXT#2/vm9_m0.bin` image allowed Seg3 to complete at `1057/1057`
events and 87 callbacks, with two clock syscalls and no clock-slot override or
callback-page injection.

This is a constructor-boundary improvement for one captured input, not a
parameterized signer. It still depends on captured native state for Seg3 and
does not change the pure-Python current-Medusa or no-JVM Rust status. The
sanitized evidence record is
[evidence/vm9_static_constructor_x1_20261001.json](evidence/vm9_static_constructor_x1_20261001.json).

## Dispatcher continuation and input-pairing correction (2026-10-01)

The successful `90385/90385` Seg2 result requires the paired input set used by
the evidence record: the corrected Seg1 checkpoint, the same-capture `NEXT#1`
handoff, and the clean runner whose SHA256 is
`8e1f2b031091d0588dcab46368c2f6b6ca8b1151bf2e890bfeb418b4bc2aa741`. A fresh
recheck with that tuple reproduced 121 callbacks and the existing checkpoint
SHA256 `86a379cca5c8f98cd5c47ac79d001e3a82de3ff2db2263eaaf9a814f027dd3cd`.
Running the raw trial memory files as if they were the same input is invalid:
their allocator state is different and the transition cleanup fails before
Seg2.

Starting that rechecked checkpoint with the paired `NEXT#2` handoff also
reached `1057/1057` Seg3 events and 87 callbacks, with two `clock_gettime`
syscalls, no callback-page injection, and no clock-slot override. This is the
same captured-state boundary proof as the existing static-constructor record,
not a fresh-input signer.

The later continuation experiment was a diagnostic branch, not a replacement
runner. It changed callback `0x12548a4c` to return through `0x1242aa4c`, injected
dispatcher scratch registers, copied native backing slots into the Python VM,
and stopped before `0x125083e0`. That branch observed
`e4ffc9a0=0` and `R2=0` while the trace expected `R2=0x122a0d00`; the full
backing readback therefore created a false register interpretation. The
paired clean replay completes without that injection. `e4ffc9a0` is a native
boundary object slot, not a directly readable Python R2 backing slot. The
sanitized diagnostic record is
[evidence/vm9_dispatcher_slot_refutation_20261001.json](evidence/vm9_dispatcher_slot_refutation_20261001.json).

## OP29 generic rule and second-input recheck (2026-10-01)

The native handler at `libmetasec_ml_71332.so + 0x16e8f0` was disassembled as
OP29/sub34, a signed `BLEZ` branch. Its source register is
`((dw >> 27) & 0x10) | ((dw >> 7) & 0x0f)` and its 16-bit branch immediate is
assembled from the five encoded fields. The VM advances by `4 + imm * 4` only
when the signed source value is non-positive; otherwise it advances by four.
The old `dw == 0x1800811d` fixed-jump special case was removed.

A second URL capture then exercised that exact encoding at trace event 119035:
the source was `R2`, the decoded immediate was `208`, and the native write at
`+0x16eaa4` changed BCP from `0x123ceadc` to `0x123cee20`:

```text
0x123ceadc + 4 + 208 * 4 = 0x123cee20
```

With the generic rule, the paired second-input replay reached `90385/90385`
Seg2 events and 121 native callbacks from `NEXT#1`, then `1057/1057` Seg3
events and 87 callbacks from `NEXT#2`. The clean recheck used no callback-page
injection, allocator-field transplant, clock-slot override, or dispatcher
backing-slot injection. This closes the OP29 decoder/branch assumption for the
captured pair. It still consumes captured host handoffs and native ARM64
images, so it does not close current pure-Python Medusa parameterization.
The sanitized record is
[evidence/vm9_op29_generic_20261001.json](evidence/vm9_op29_generic_20261001.json).

## Meaning for the deliverables

- Seg2 has complete captured diagnostic runs (`90161/90161` with the
  historical branch transplant, `90153/90153` from a fresh same-run host
  handoff, and `90385/90385` for the static-constructor second URL), but it is
  not an independent pure-Python parameterization.
- Seg3 now completes `1057/1057` from the same-run handoff without a clock-slot
  override. The older page-assisted replay remains complete only for its
  captured sample. Neither is a general current-version signer.
- The old 225-byte Python Medusa implementation remains valid only for its old
  snapshot vectors.
- The no-JVM Rust crate must continue to return an explicit unavailable error
  for current Medusa until the allocator/constructor boundary is reproduced
  from fresh inputs.

## Next experiment

Use a new fresh URL/input capture to carry the native constructor, allocator,
and host handoff state through Seg1–Seg3 without loading captured `NEXT#1` or
`NEXT#2` memory. The resulting body must then be checked against a new live
directory/reader matrix; matching a captured body alone is insufficient.
