# Current VM9 progress checkpoint

This file records the current state of the independent VM9 work. It is a
checkpoint, not a completion claim.

## Reproduced diagnostic path

The historical `seg3_verified_final_20260929.txt` path can be reproduced with
the captured `event0_cb66_vm9_*` memory image and the real callback pages for
callbacks 9, 64, and 66. The fresh replay reached:

```text
SUMMARY events=1057/1057 callbacks=87 syscalls=3
```

This proves that the VM bytecode trace, the selected native callback execution,
and the recorded page injections are internally consistent for that captured
sample. It remains trace-assisted because the callback pages and native ARM64
execution are supplied externally.

## Current checkpoint mismatch

The newer `mem_after_seg2_full_diag_20260929.pkl` checkpoint does not reproduce
that path. It diverges at trace 758 after callback 8:

| Path | callback 8 allocator result | callback 8 writes |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| reproduced historical path | `0x1296b940` | 80 |
| new full-Seg2 checkpoint | `0x1296ba60` | 33 |

The native callback therefore selects a different allocator/free-list branch.
The divergence is before callback 9's real-page injection and is not fixed by
adding Perseus, changing the timestamp, or replaying the same callback pages.

The follow-up allocator audit narrowed the branch further. For callback 8 the
requested size maps to size class `3` and bin `0x12282060`. The historical
checkpoint has count `0` and returns `0x1296b940` through the refill path; the
new checkpoint has count `4` and returns `0x1296ba60` from free-list index `2`.
Forcing only the count to zero, or copying the complete `0x12282000` bin page,
still returned `0x1296b9a0`. Native disassembly and a controlled transplant
then isolated the missing state to the slab counter `[0x1294110c]` and bitmap
word `[0x12941128]`; with those two fields plus the count corrected, callback 8
returned `0x1296b940`.

## Seg1 entry-base and native-frame corrections

The first independent Seg1 runner used the nested-frame jump-base field that
belongs to the later segments. That made the first apparent branch at trace
120 look like a VM or allocator mismatch. Re-running with the actual Seg1
entry base `0x1235a6f0` removed that false divergence. A second mismatch was
then isolated to the native callback context: the diagnostic runner still used
Seg2's `SP=0xe4ffbd70` and `X29=0xe4ffbe90` for Seg1, while the captured Seg1
frame has `SP=0xe4ffb320` and `X29=0xe4ffb440`. With the wrong frame, callback
19 overwrote its argument area and callback 20 reached libc's explicit
`Invalid address 0xe4ffb848 passed to free` abort. Returning zero from
`exit_group` in the early syscall probe had hidden that abort and produced an
irrelevant unmapped read and `accept4` loop.

With the Seg1 frame corrected, the real ARM64 callback runner completed the
captured Seg1 trace: `4592/4592` VM events, 85 callbacks, and one `madvise`
syscall. No callback-page injection was needed for this Seg1 run. The resulting
checkpoint advanced into Seg2 and matched its first 10 native callbacks. The
sanitized diagnostic record is
[evidence/vm9_seg1_frame_probe_20260930.json](evidence/vm9_seg1_frame_probe_20260930.json).

The next full Seg2 attempt reached callback 45 and then diverged at VM trace
`12085` because `[0xe4ffcd00]` remained `0x2f8` in the corrected checkpoint
while the historical Seg1 checkpoint expected `0x2f6`. This field is part of
the captured input/host state rather than a proven allocator rule; the run is
therefore recorded as a new handoff boundary, not as a failure of the Seg1
frame correction.

This is a diagnostic correction, not a completion claim. The runner still
executes captured ARM64 native code against captured memory, and its Seg1
`X22` frame value is inferred from the frame offset rather than directly
observed. The next independent proof must carry the corrected state through
Seg2 and Seg3 without captured-field transplants, then repeat with a fresh
input before treating it as a parameterized signer.

Applying that fixed checkpoint transplant at callback 8 allowed the full
captured Seg2 replay to complete at `90161/90161` events with `121` callbacks.
This closes the captured branch diagnostic, not the independent parameterization
requirement. See [ALLOCATOR_AUDIT.md](ALLOCATOR_AUDIT.md).

## Meaning for the deliverables

- Seg2 has a complete diagnostic run (`90161/90161` events), but it is not an
  independent pure-Python parameterization.
- Seg3 has a complete trace-assisted replay for one captured sample, but it is
  not a general current-version signer.
- The old 225-byte Python Medusa implementation remains valid only for its old
  snapshot vectors.
- The no-JVM Rust crate must continue to return an explicit unavailable error
  for current Medusa until the allocator/constructor boundary is reproduced
  from fresh inputs.

## Next experiment

The next useful experiment is to model the allocator's slab acquisition and
bitmap updates from a fresh chain, then rerun Seg2 and Seg3 with a new input
vector without transplanting captured fields. A successful replay must then be
checked against a new live directory/reader matrix; matching the old captured
body alone is insufficient.
