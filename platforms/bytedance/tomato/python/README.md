# Tomato Python material

`fq_crypto.py`, `helios_vm.py`, and `medusa_f13.py` contain the pure primitives and sample checks extracted during the analysis.

`medusa_body.py` and `medusa_body_legacy_snapshot.py` are deliberately labelled as the old 225-byte snapshot implementation. The current online VM produces different branches and is only available through the Java/Unidbg bridge in the original isolated workspace. Do not import this module into a current downloader and infer online compatibility from a local 225-byte match.

The Python files are research fixtures. They do not contain the private device configuration or raw online trial material.
